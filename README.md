# DemoApp for Sticky Footer

This demo app is part of an article on [theCodeCampus Blog](https://www.thecodecampus.de/blog/).
The article can be found [here](https://www.thecodecampus.de/blog/material-2-sticky-footer-mat-sidenav/).
This example uses Angular 7 and Material 2.

## What is it about?

My guess is your using [Angular](https://angular.io/) in combination with 
[Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) and you need a 
[sticky footer](https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/), which is under
given circumstances not well documented. The footer supports a variable height.

## Can you point me directly to the solution?

The most important file is `src/app/app.component.scss`.
Here you can find the scss rules to support a sticky footer.

## Run the example

Clone it and run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
