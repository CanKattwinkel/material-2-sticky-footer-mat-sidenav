# Demo App for Sticky Footer with Angular 7 and Material 2

This simple demo app is part of an updated article on [theCodeCampus blog](https://www.thecodecampus.de/blog/).
The article can be found [here](https://www.thecodecampus.de/blog/material-2-sticky-footer-mat-sidenav/).  
This example uses Angular 7 and Material 2.  

## Where can I find the running demo?

Follow [this link](https://cankattwinkel.github.io/material-2-sticky-footer-mat-sidenav/).

## What is it about?

My guess is your using [Angular](https://angular.io/) in combination with 
[Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) and you need a 
[sticky footer](https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/), which is under
given circumstances not well documented.  
The footer supports a variable height.

## TL;DR

The most important file is `src/app/app.component.scss`.
There you can find the scss rules to support a sticky footer.

## Run the example

Clone this project and run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
